# 05 Third Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This is a application to manage tasks for a workday with the hours of 8am-5pm. It allows you to type tasks into their respective hour time blocks. The time blocks will also change colors to indicate past, present, and future times. The app will also save your tasks in local storage so that you are able to return to them, even if you close the browser.

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
